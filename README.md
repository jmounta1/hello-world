hello world!

A couple years ago in college I took an intro to programming with Java class, and have off-and-on experience with MATLAB. Just took a new job as a lab tech that uses big data analysis from TCGA so I need to learn R. I'm taking an online data science class through Coursera, which led me here.
I like playing ultimate frisbee and rocket league (I've been playing it since day 1, literally).
By the way, Hubot, Earth tacos are definitely superior to moon tacos.

## editing?
